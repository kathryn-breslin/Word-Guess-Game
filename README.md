# The Word Guess Game
#### A hangman-style guessing game!

## About
This application runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript.

The app randomly selects a word out of an established array and listens for key events representing the user's chosen letter. 
The game begins with the user selecting any key on their keyboard, who attempts to guess the word that is represented by underscores, like "- - - - - -". 

The game player is given ten (10) letter attempts during the game and, if they guess the correct letter, the underscores are replaced with that correct guess. For example, if the word "pedal" is represented as "_ _ _ _ _", correct guesses reveal themselves as "p e d _ l". 

Throughout the game, the letters the user has guessed display themselves on the scoreboard. 

This application was built using **JavaScript**, **HTML** and **CSS**.
